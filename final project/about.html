        <p>
            If you stop and think about it, our lives are built by moments: moments that can change your life, and everyday moments that create your life.
            In today's world, there's not much time to appreciate what's in front of us. Everything feels temporary and disposable. Nothing is around long enough to move us. To make us feel connected; to make us feel human and we won't stand for that.
            We exist to help you see those moments, to pause them, and to relive them in something you can hold in your hand and turn to forever. From our refurbished vintage Polaroid cameras to the Polaroid Lab, we create beautiful, life-enriching tools to ground you in the here and now.
